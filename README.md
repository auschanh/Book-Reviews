Web Programming with Python(Flask) and SQL

This is Project 1 for CS50W.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and show my understanding of:
1) handling of sessions (login and logout) with flask
2) registration system with data insertion into an SQL database hosted by Heroku
3) searching data through API calls to GoodReads Book Reviews
4) creating my own API calls for user created reviews
